Unchained Melody

    Ghost   Alex North

Oh, my love, my darling

I've hungered for your touch

A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly

Yet time can do so much

Are you still mine

I need your love 

I need your love 

God, speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea

To the open arms of the sea

Lonely river sigh, wait for me wait for me

I'll be coming home 

Wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling

I'm hungered, hungered for your touch

A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly and time can do so much

Are you still mine 

I need your love 

I need your love 

God speed your love to me










Oh, my love, my darling

I've hungered for your touch 

A long, linely time

And time goes by so slowly

And time can do so much

Are you still mine

I need your love

I need your love 

God, speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea

To the open arms of the sea

Lonely river sigh, wait for me wait for me 

I'll be coming home

Wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling

I hungered, hungered for your touch

A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly yet time can do so much

Are you still mine 

I need your love

I need your love

God speed your love to me








Beautiful in white
